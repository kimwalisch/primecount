/// @file  D.cpp
/// @brief This is a highly optimized implementation of the D(x, y)
///        formula in Xavier Gourdon's prime counting algorithm. The D
///        formula is very similar to the formula of the hard special
///        leaves in the Deleglise-Rivat algorithm. Hence this
///        implementation is basically identical to S2_hard.cpp except
///        that the bounds have been changed slightly.
///
///        This implementation uses multi-threading with advanced load
///        balancing, it scales well up to a large number of CPU cores
///        because the compute threads are completely independent from
///        each other. This implementation also uses the highly
///        optimized Sieve class and the DFactorTable class which is a
///        compressed lookup table of moebius function values,
///        least prime factors and max prime factors.
