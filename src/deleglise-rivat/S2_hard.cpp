/// @brief Calculate the contribution of the hard special leaves using
///        a prime sieve. This is a multi-threaded implementation
///        which uses compression (PiTable & FactorTable) to reduce
///        the memory usage by about 10x.
///
///        Usually the computation of the hard special leaves
///        requires a binary indexed tree a.k.a. Fenwick tree to count
///        the number of unsieved elements in O(log n) time. But it
///        is actually much faster to simply count the number of
///        unsieved elements directly from the sieve array using the
///        POPCNT instruction. Hence this implementation does not use
///        a binary indexed tree.
///
///        This implementation is based on the paper:
///        Tom√°s Oliveira e Silva, Computing pi(x): the combinatorial
///        method, Revista do DETUA, vol. 4, no. 6, March 2006,
///        pp. 759-768.
