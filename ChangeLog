  Version 5.4 work in progress.

  This version fixes a scaling issue that has been present in
  primecount since the first version. The computation of the
  hard special leaves (S2_hard & D formulas) used a flawed
  optimization that deteriorated the runtime complexity of the
  algorithm. The new version should run much faster for record
  computations >= 10^23.

  * primecount.h: New C API. primecount now has both a C API
    (primecount.h) and a C++ API (primecount.hpp).
  * app.cpp: Contains C++ API function implementations.
  * app_c.cpp: Contains C API function implementations.
  * Sieve.cpp: Implemented O(sqrt(sieve_size)) counting,
    previously counting was O(sieve_size).
  * D.cpp: Use improved Sieve::count() method.
  * S2_hard.cpp: Use improved Sieve::count() method.
  * pi_lmo_parallel.cpp: Use improved Sieve::count() method.
  * common.cpp: Tune alpha factors.
  * LoadBalancer.cpp: Refactor using new ThreadSettings struct.
  * find_optimal_alpha_*.sh: New scripts that find optimal
    alpha tuning factors using the Linux perf tool.

  Version 5.2 released.

  I have now implemented Xavier Gourdon's algorithm in the
  primecount-backup version (branch backup3). Other than that
  there have been documentation improvements and build system
  improvements which should make it easier to package
  primecount for e.g. Linux distros (see BUILD.md).

  * Sieve.cpp: Fix vector out of bounds.
  * cmdoptions.cpp: Support options of type: --option VALUE.
  * doc/BUILD.md: Detailed build instructions. Contains new
    section: "Packaging primecount" for Linux distros.
  * doc/primecount.1: Add primecount man page.
  * doc/primecount.txt: AsciiDoc, used to generate primecount.1.
  * CMakeLists.txt: Generate man page using a2x program.
  * CMakeLists.txt: New option: -DBUILD_LIBPRIMESIEVE=OFF.
  * Get rid of underscores in command-line options:

      --deleglise_rivat -> --deleglise-rivat
      --S2_trivial      -> --S2-trivial
      --S2_easy         -> --S2-easy
      --S2_hard         -> --S2-hard

  Version 5.1 released.

  The memory usage of Xavier Gourdon's algorithm has been
  reduced from O(x^(1/2)) to O(x^(1/3) * log^3 x). Xavier
  Gourdon's algorithm is now fully implemented and luckily it
  scales well up to a very large number of CPU cores. Xavier
  Gourdon's algorithm is now enabled by default for
  numbers > 10^7.

  * main.cpp: New options: --AC, --B, --D, --Phi0, --Sigma.
  * SegmentedPiTable.cpp: New PiTable implementation.
  * AC.cpp: Combine the A & C formulas to improve scaling.
  * D4.cpp: Tighter bounds, minor speedup.
  * Sigma.cpp: Reduce initialization overhead.
  * Sieve.cpp: Improved pre-sieving.
  * S2_hard.cpp: Improved pre-sieving.
  * print.cpp: Updated for Gourdon's algorithm.

  === C++ API Changes ===

  In order to simplify the API the following functions have
  been removed from the primecount.hpp header:

  int64_t pi_deleglise_rivat(int64_t x);
  int64_t pi_legendre(int64_t x);
  int64_t pi_lehmer(int64_t x);
  int64_t pi_lmo(int64_t x);
  int64_t pi_meissel(int64_t x);
  int64_t pi_primesieve(int64_t x);

  You should use pi(x) instead which is an alias for the
  fastest prime counting function implementation in
  primecount.

2019-08-13 Kim Walisch  <kim.walisch@gmail.com>

  Version 5.0 released.

  I have finally implemented Xavier Gourdon's prime counting

  the Deleglise-Rivat algorithm.

  above 10^20! Furthermore the S2_hard algorithm for

  * src/mpi: primecount MPI source code.
  * include/FactorTable.hpp: Multi-threaded initialization.

  The distributed version of primecount is named primecount-mpi and
  the code can be found at:

  https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount/tree/mpi

  * src/phi.cpp: 2x speed up due to pi(x) lookup table optimization.

2015-10-07 Kim Walisch  <kim.walisch@gmail.com>

  Version 2.3 released.

  This version runs about 10% faster for x <= 10^21. Because of the
  sieving optimizations implemented in primecount-2.2 the sieving
  limit has now been increased which reduces the time to compute the
  easy special leaves.

  I have now also officially published primecount-backup binaries
  which save intermediate results to a file once per hour and which
  can resume from these files after e.g. a crash:
  https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount/tree/backup

  * Renamed to --P2, --S1, --S2_trivial, --S2_easy, --S2_hard.
  * find_fastest_alpha.sh: Benchmark which finds fastest alpha factors.

2015-03-26 Kim Walisch  <kim.walisch@gmail.com>

  hard special leaves and contains a new algorithm for the computation
  of the ordinary leaves which uses half as much memory.

  * src/S1.cpp: New implementation based on Douglas Staple's algorithm.

  to distribute the computation of large pi(x) values on multiple
  systems. This version also fixes two non-critical bugs.

  * src/deleglise-rivat/S2_trivial.cpp: Fix off by 1 bug.
  * src/deleglise-rivat/*: Bugfix, set 1 and unset 2 in sieve.

  * src/print.cpp: New print functions for terminal output.

2015-02-28 Kim Walisch  <kim.walisch@gmail.com>

  Version 1.8 released.

  This version reduces the memory usage of the Deleglise-Rivat
  implementation by up to 30 percent. Instead of using the same set of
  memory intense data structures for all formulas (P2, S1, S2_trvial,
  S2_easy, S2_hard), each individual formula now generates its own set
  of data structures and the size of each data structure is the
  smallest possible for the given formula.

  * -a<N>, --alpha=<N>: Manually set the tuning factor.
  * src/primecount.cpp: Improved alpha factor formula.
  * src/deleglise-rivat/*: Reduce memory usage.
  * src/lmo/*: Update S1(x) function calls.
  * src/nth_prime.cpp: Add optimization for small primes.
  * src/app/*: Add --alpha option.

  * avoid_128bit_div.patch: Renamed

2015-01-24 Kim Walisch  <kim.walisch@gmail.com>

  Version 1.7 released.

  This version runs to 20% faster on Windows for numbers >= 2^63 by
  using 64-bit divisions instead of 128-bit divisions whenever
  possible. While primecount-1.6 has already been very fast on Linux
  it ran slower on Windows, primecount-1.7 now achieves the same
  speed on both Windows and Linux.

  * fast_div.patch: Avoid 128-bit divisions.

2015-01-05 Kim Walisch  <kim.walisch@gmail.com>

  Version 1.6 released.

  This version calculates hard special leaves much faster, above a
  certain threshold the algorithm switches to POPCNT for counting the
  number of unsieved elements (instead of Tomás Oliveira's special
  tree data structure) which dramatically improves memory efficiency.
  This version also fixes a serious bug in P2(x, a) for x > 10^21,
  thanks to Dana Jacobsen for reporting it.

  * src/deleglise-rivat/S2_hard.cpp: Add POPCNT optimization.

  * include/min.hpp: Refactoring.
  * include/int128.hpp: Add int128_t trait functions.

2014-12-27 Kim Walisch  <kim.walisch@gmail.com>

  Version 1.5 released.

  This version runs up to 30 percent faster than primecount-1.4 for
  numbers > 2^64. The speed up is achieved using a clever trick:
  Instead of calculating xn = x / (primes[b] * primes[l]) which uses
  a 128-bit division, x2 = x / primes[b] is calculated upfront and
  then xn = x2 / primes[l]. If x2 is < 2^64 then xn can be calculated
  using a 64-bit division which is much faster.

  * src/deleglise-rivat/S2_*.cpp: Avoid 128-bit divisions.
  * src/S2Status.cpp: Improved status precision.
  * src/app/cmdoptions.cpp: Set -l = --lmo instead of --lehmer.
  * README.md: Add command-line options summary.
