Changes in primecount-7.0, 2021-04-28

In primecout-6.x the AC algorithm scales very badly on PCs & servers
with a large number of CPU cores. The two root causes of this scaling
issue are cache misses and thread synchronization overhead. In
primecount-7.0 the AC algorithm has been completely rewritten, now
all threads are independent from each other and require only minimal
synchronization. Furthermore each thread operates on its own tiny
chunk of memory that conveniently fits into the CPU's cache. On my
dual socket AMD EPYC server this improves performance by more than 2x
for large AC computations with x >= 1e23. The P2 & B algorithms have
also been rewritten so that the threads are independent from each
other.

An in-depth description of the new AC algorithm is available at:
https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount/blob/master/doc/Easy-Special-Leaves.md

* util.cpp: Improve scaling using larger default alpha_z = 2.
* imath.hpp: Optimize ilog2() & next_power_of_2() using __builtin_clzll().
* Remove MPI support: No users, too much work to maintain.

Changes in primecount-6.4, 2021-03-20

This version fixes a critical integer overflow in the B formula
which is part of Xavier Gourdon's prime counting algorithm. The
integer overflow occurred when computing B(x) with x > 1e25, this bug
has been present in primecount-6.1, 6.2 and 6.3. This version also
adds a workaround for a severe scaling issue in Clang's OpenMP 
library (Clang 11, 2021) that occurs when using dynamic thread
scheduling combined with long running computations. Because of this
issue primecount-6.3 compiled with Clang takes 2.5x longer to
compute AC(1e24) than primecount-6.3 compiled with GCC on my
dual-socket AMD EPYC Rome server. I have submitted a bug report
to LLVM which contains more information:
https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49588

Changes in primecount-6.3, 2021-03-05

  The memory usage of the PiTable and SegmentedPiTable has been
  reduced by about 2x, this speeds up the computation of the easy
  special leaves (S2_easy & AC formulas) by up to 30% for large pi(x)
  computations with x >= 1e23. Furthermore the partial sieve function
  a.k.a. phi(x, a) has been improved significantly, it now runs 3 to
  5x faster for most input. phi(x, a) is used extensively by many
  other functions such as pi_legendre(x) and pi_meissel(x) which now
  also run up to 5x faster.

  * PiTable.cpp: Reduce memory usage by 2x.
  * SegmentedPiTable.cpp: Reduce memory usage by 2x.

  * generate_phi.hpp: Same optimizations as phi.cpp.
  * LoadBalancer.cpp: Tune for new phi(x, a) implementation.
  * FactorTable.hpp: Reduce number of branches.
  * DFactorTable.hpp: Reduce number of branches.

Changes in primecount-6.2, 2021-01-07

  The sieving algorithm has been improved by annotating branches
  with likely/unlikely and __builtin_unreachable(). This improves
  the performance of the S2_hard and D formulas by up to 5%. GCC
  benefits most from these changes (Clang's performance was
  already very good before). With this release there is also a new
  primecount-backup version (last primecount-backup release was 6.0).

  In order to reduce the amount of work for myself there will be no
  precompiled binaries anymore going forward. You can now install
  primecount using your operating system's package manager (if it
  is available there) or by compiling it from source yourself.

  * Use Appveyor-CI instead of Travis-CI for testing.
  * README.md: primecount can now be installed using package managers.
  * Sieve.cpp: Annotate branches with unlikely, up to 5% speedup.
  * Sieve.cpp: Annotate switch cases with fallthrough.
  * AC.cpp: Reduce number of function paramaters.

  * P2.cpp: Improve GCC performance.
  * popcnt.hpp: Improve GCC performance.

Changes in primecount-6.1, 2020-09-12

  The main focus of this release has been on polishing the code
  and improving the documentation. I also tried many things to
  improve the scaling on servers with a large number of CPU cores,
  however I only achieved minor speed ups. The only meaningful
  improvement is that the same threads are now reused throughout
  the entire AC computation. This improves the scaling for small
  to medium sized computations up to 10^20. GCC benefits most
  from this change whereas Clang performance is mostly unchanged.

  * Xavier Gourdon's algorithm has been distributed using MPI
    so that computations can now run on HPC clusters.
  * CMakeLists.txt: New WITH_JEMALLOC option (default OFF).
  * AC.cpp: Reuse the same threads throughout the computation.
  * AC.cpp: Improve upper bound of C2 formula.
  * AC.cpp: Avoid branch inside hot loop of A formula.
  * SegmentedPiTable.cpp: Reuse threads from AC.cpp.
  * LoadBalancerP2.cpp: New load balancer for P2 & B.
  * phi.cpp: Reduce caching for tiny numbers.
  * generate_phi.hpp: Reduce caching for tiny numbers.
  * pod_vector.hpp: Like std::vector, but without default
    initialization (useful when allocating 100s of GiB).
  * PiTable.cpp: Multi-threaded initialization.
  * Status.cpp: Avoid thread synchronization when printing
    in order to improve scaling of AC and S2_easy.
  * Status.cpp: Improve S2_hard & D status accuracy.
  * StatusAC.cpp: More accurate status for AC formula.
  * cmdoptions.cpp: Add -B & -D options.
  * Fixed #32: primecount-backup prints incorrect time elapsed.

Changes in primecount-6.0, 2020-03-16

  This version fixes a scaling issue that has been present in
  primecount since the first version. The computation of the
  hard special leaves (S2_hard & D formulas) used a flawed
  optimization that deteriorated the runtime complexity of the
  algorithm. The doc/Special-Leaves.md document contains more
  information. The new version should run much faster for large
  computations >= 10^23.

  * Sieve.cpp: Implemented O(sqrt(sieve_size)) counting,
    previously counting was O(sieve_size).
  * AC_libdivide.cpp: Up to 20% faster using GCC.
  * S2_easy_libdivide.cpp: Up to 20% faster using GCC.
  * primecount.h: New C API. primecount now has both a C API
    (primecount.h) and a C++ API (primecount.hpp).
  * LoadBalancer.cpp: Refactor using new ThreadSettings struct.
  * find_optimal_alpha_*.sh: New scripts that find optimal
    alpha tuning factors using the Linux perf tool.

Changes in primecount-5.3, 2020-01-18

Changes in primecount-5.2, 2019-11-17

  I have now implemented Xavier Gourdon's algorithm in the
  primecount-backup version (branch backup3). Other than that
  there have been documentation improvements and build system
  improvements which should make it easier to package
  primecount for e.g. Linux distros (see BUILD.md).

  * Sieve.cpp: Fix vector out of bounds.
  * cmdoptions.cpp: Support options of type: --option VALUE.
  * doc/BUILD.md: Detailed build instructions. Contains new

      --deleglise_rivat -> --deleglise-rivat
      --S2_trivial      -> --S2-trivial
      --S2_easy         -> --S2-easy
      --S2_hard         -> --S2-hard

Changes in primecount-5.1, 2019-09-02

  The memory usage of Xavier Gourdon's algorithm has been
  reduced from O(x^(1/2)) to O(x^(1/3) * log^3 x). Xavier
  Gourdon's algorithm is now fully implemented and luckily it
  scales well up to a very large number of CPU cores. Xavier
  Gourdon's algorithm is now enabled by default for
  numbers > 10^7.

  * main.cpp: New options: --AC, --B, --D, --Phi0, --Sigma.
  * SegmentedPiTable.cpp: New PiTable implementation.
  * AC.cpp: Combine the A & C formulas to improve scaling.
  * D4.cpp: Tighter bounds, minor speedup.
  * Sigma.cpp: Reduce initialization overhead.
  * Sieve.cpp: Improved pre-sieving.
  * S2_hard.cpp: Improved pre-sieving.
  * print.cpp: Updated for Gourdon's algorithm.

  === C++ API Changes ===

  In order to simplify the API the following functions have
  been removed from the primecount.hpp header:

  int64_t pi_deleglise_rivat(int64_t x);
  int64_t pi_legendre(int64_t x);
  int64_t pi_lehmer(int64_t x);
  int64_t pi_lmo(int64_t x);
  int64_t pi_meissel(int64_t x);
  int64_t pi_primesieve(int64_t x);

  You should use pi(x) instead which is an alias for the
  fastest prime counting function implementation in
  primecount.

Changes in primecount-5.0, 2019-08-13

  I have finally implemented Xavier Gourdon's prime counting
  algorithm! Xavier Gourdon's algorithm is an improved

  limit has now been increased which reduces the time to compute the
  easy special leaves.

  I have now also officially published primecount-backup binaries
  which save intermediate results to a file once per hour and which
  can resume from these files after e.g. a crash:
  https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount/tree/backup

  * Renamed to --P2, --S1, --S2_trivial, --S2_easy, --S2_hard.
  * find_fastest_alpha.sh: Benchmark which finds fastest alpha factors.

Changes in primecount-1.9, 2015-03-08

  This version introduces new command-line options for calculating
  intermediate formulas of the Deleglise-Rivat algorithm. This allows
  to distribute the computation of large pi(x) values on multiple

Changes in primecount-1.8, 2015-02-28

  This version reduces the memory usage of the Deleglise-Rivat
  implementation by up to 30 percent. Instead of using the same set of
  memory intense data structures for all formulas (P2, S1, S2_trvial,
  S2_easy, S2_hard), each individual formula now generates its own set
  of data structures and the size of each data structure is the
  smallest possible for the given formula.

  * Makefile.am: Add avoid_128bit_div.patch to EXTRA_DIST
  * avoid_128bit_div.patch: Renamed

Changes in primecount-1.7, 2015-01-24

  This version runs to 20% faster on Windows for numbers >= 2^63 by
  using 64-bit divisions instead of 128-bit divisions whenever
  possible. While primecount-1.6 has already been very fast on Linux
  it ran slower on Windows, primecount-1.7 now achieves the same
  speed on both Windows and Linux.

  * fast_div.patch: Avoid 128-bit divisions.

Changes in primecount-1.6, 2015-01-05

  This version calculates hard special leaves much faster, above a
  certain threshold the algorithm switches to POPCNT for counting the
  number of unsieved elements (instead of Tomás Oliveira's special
  tree data structure) which dramatically improves memory efficiency.
  This version also fixes a serious bug in P2(x, a) for x > 10^21,
  thanks to Dana Jacobsen for reporting it.

  * src/deleglise-rivat/S2_hard.cpp: Add POPCNT optimization.
  * src/lmo/pi_lmo_parallel3: Add POPCNT optimization.
  * src/lmo/pi_lmo5: Add POPCNT optimization.
  * src/P2.cpp: Bug fix for numbers > 10^21.
  * src/BitSieve.hpp: Improved memory efficiency.
  * include/isqrt.hpp: Fixed C++11 bug in isqrt(x).
  * include/min.hpp: Refactoring.
  * include/int128.hpp: Add int128_t trait functions.

Changes in primecount-1.5, 2014-12-27

  This version runs up to 30 percent faster than primecount-1.4 for
  numbers > 2^64. The speed up is achieved using a clever trick:
  Instead of calculating xn = x / (primes[b] * primes[l]) which uses
  a 128-bit division, x2 = x / primes[b] is calculated upfront and
  then xn = x2 / primes[l]. If x2 is < 2^64 then xn can be calculated
  using a 64-bit division which is much faster.

  * src/deleglise-rivat/S2_*.cpp: Avoid 128-bit divisions.
  * src/S2Status.cpp: Improved status precision.
  * src/app/cmdoptions.cpp: Set -l = --lmo instead of --lehmer.
  * README.md: Add command-line options summary.
